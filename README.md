# PersonalProject
Problem Statement: Ideally, my project would run bug free and have a well developed GUI with user-friendly features that will make me feel proud on what I've worked on. Realistically my program will have almost no bugs, with comments explaining what certain lines of code do, and keep the users intreagued for a while.

Outline goals: 
Use GUIs to create a game 
Use java to build a game from scratch 

Chart Boundaries: 
limitations to OS
Don't own a Raspberry Pi

Success Criteria: 
Minimal bugs 
Be proud of what I have created 
Learned about GUIs 

Constraints: 
Knowledge in GUIs 

Assumptions: 
Everything working on time 

Stakeholders: 
Professor 
Classmates 
Potential future employers 

Timelines: 
6 weeks 

Detailed timeline 

1) Do tutorials to learn about GUIs more, and get a Java project working. (2 hours)
So far I've learned that there are more tutorials for Java and it is a lot easier to get set up for a java project.

2) Work on a kilobolt tutorial, see if it's what you want.http://www.kilobolt.com/game-development-tutorial.html Integrate your knowledge from the tutorial into code. 

3) Work on unit 2, and integrate that information into your own project (Skip around to things that you dont know).

4) Unit 3

5) Unit 4

6) Test program out, add necessary comments, javadocs, and spot bugs.
